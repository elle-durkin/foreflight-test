# Airport Information Application

#### Time Spent
I spent approximately 8 hours developing this application. 
    
#### How to run
When running locally, access the app via it’s swagger endpoint, http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html. 
     
#### Quick Note
While I included temp anyways, despite trying to find the field in multiple airport’s forecasts, I never saw the field temp appear. 


#### Possible Improvements
    1. Create a real front end.
    2. Encode/encrypt credentials. 
    2. Create tests. Given the time constraints, I chose to focus on getting the app completed and not on writing tests as I went.
